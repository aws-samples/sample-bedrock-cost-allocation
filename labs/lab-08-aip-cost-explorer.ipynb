    "# Lab 08: AIP Cost Tracking with AWS Cost Explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing Application Inference Profiles (AIPs) in Labs 1-7, you now have **operational visibility** through CloudWatch metrics. But your CFO just asked the ultimate question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**💰 \"Show me the actual dollar costs per customer for our AI spending.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "- CloudWatch shows **usage metrics** (invocations, tokens) but not **actual costs**\n",
    "- You need **precise cost allocation** per tenant for accurate billing\n",
    "- Finance team requires **cost trends** and **spending patterns** by customer\n",
    "- You must prove ROI and justify AI infrastructure investments\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: AWS Cost Explorer + AIP Tags**\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Application Inference Profiles with AWS Cost Explorer, you can:\n",
    "- ✅ Track **actual dollar costs** per tenant using AIP tags\n",
    "- ✅ Generate **accurate bills** for usage-based pricing\n",
    "- ✅ Identify **cost trends** and **spending patterns** by customer\n",
    "- ✅ Create **financial reports** for executive dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you'll master:\n",
    "- Fetching Bedrock costs from AWS Cost Explorer filtered by AIP tags\n",
    "- Creating cost visualizations and financial reports\n",
    "- Implementing multi-tenant cost allocation for accurate billing\n",
    "- Building executive dashboards with cost trends and breakdowns\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Cost Data Retrieval** - Fetch Bedrock costs by tenant using Cost Explorer API\n",
    "2. **📊 Cost Visualizations** - Create charts showing cost trends and breakdowns\n",
    "3. **💼 Financial Reports** - Generate summary tables for billing and finance teams\n",
    "4. **📈 Executive Dashboard** - Build comprehensive cost monitoring for leadership\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready to track real costs?** Let's start by fetching actual Bedrock spending per tenant..."
