    "# Lab 02: Application Inference Profiles - The Solution & CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lab 01**, you experienced the multi-tenant metrics problem: **System Inference Profiles** aggregate all tenant usage together, making per-tenant tracking impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you're back at AnyCompany Solutions as **Alex, Platform Engineer**, and you've discovered **Application Inference Profiles (AIP)** - AWS Bedrock's solution for multi-tenant AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Platform Context:**\n",
    "You're building a **Multi-Tenant Marketing Platform** that serves multiple enterprise clients:\n",
    "- **Tenant A**: B2B tech company needing product launch campaigns\n",
    "- **Tenant B**: B2C retail company needing promotional campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Application Inference Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Inference Profiles (AIP)** solve the multi-tenant problem by providing:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Unique model identifiers per tenant** - Each tenant gets their own AIP ARN\n",
    "✅ **Isolated CloudWatch metrics** - Separate tracking for each tenant  \n",
    "✅ **Accurate cost allocation** - Know exactly what each tenant costs\n",
    "✅ **Usage-based billing** - Implement fair pricing with confidence\n",
    "✅ **Per-tenant SLA monitoring** - Track performance separately\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of all tenants sharing one System Inference Profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ OLD WAY: System Inference Profile (shared by all)\n",
    "modelId = \"us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tenant gets their own Application Inference Profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ NEW WAY: Application Inference Profiles (one per tenant)\n",
    "tenant_a_modelId = \"arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/marketing-ai-tenant-a\"\n",
    "tenant_b_modelId = \"arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/marketing-ai-tenant-b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Magic:** Both AIPs route to the **same underlying model** (Nova Pro 1.0), but CloudWatch tracks them **separately**!\n",
    "\n",

    "By the end of this lab, you'll master:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Core AIP Concepts\n",
    "- What Application Inference Profiles are and how they work\n",
    "- How AIPs enable multi-tenant isolation\n",
    "- The relationship between System and Application Inference Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ AIP Lifecycle Management (CRUD)\n",
    "- **Create**: Set up new AIPs for tenants\n",
    "- **Read**: Retrieve AIP details and metadata\n",
    "- **Update**: Modify AIP tags and configurations\n",
    "- **Delete**: Clean up AIPs when tenants churn\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Multi-Tenant Best Practices\n",
    "- Tagging strategies for cost allocation\n",
    "- Naming conventions for AIP management\n",
    "- Monitoring and alerting per tenant\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Application Inference Profiles** for Tenant A (and practice with Tenant B)\n",
    "2. **Tag AIPs** with marketing platform metadata (TenantId, BusinessType, CostCenter)\n",
    "3. **Retrieve and display** AIP configurations\n",
    "4. **Update tags** to demonstrate lifecycle management\n",
    "5. **Delete AIPs** to clean up resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This lab focuses on **AIP management** (CRUD operations). In **Lab 03**, you'll use these AIPs for actual multi-tenant marketing campaign generation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As **Alex, Platform Engineer**, after completing this lab you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Tell your CEO: \"We can now track costs per tenant!\"\n",
    "✅ Implement usage-based pricing with confidence\n",
    "✅ Monitor SLAs individually per tenant  \n",
    "✅ Scale your multi-tenant platform efficiently\n",

    "You've successfully learned how to manage Application Inference Profiles for multi-tenant AI applications!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Understanding AIPs\n",
    "- Learned what Application Inference Profiles are\n",
    "- Understood how they solve the multi-tenant metrics problem from Lab 01\n",
    "- Saw how AIPs provide isolated tracking while using the same underlying model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ CRUD Operations Mastery\n",
    "1. **Create**: Set up new AIPs with proper naming and tags\n",
    "2. **Read**: Retrieved AIP metadata and tags for verification\n",
    "3. **Update**: Modified tags to reflect lifecycle changes\n",
    "4. **Delete**: Cleaned up AIPs when no longer needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Multi-Tenant Best Practices\n",
    "- **Tagging Strategy**: Environment, Team, Model, CostCenter for accurate cost allocation\n",
    "- **Naming Conventions**: Timestamp-based names to avoid conflicts\n",
    "- **Lifecycle Management**: Creation, updates, and deletion workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 The AIP Architecture\n",
    "```\n",
    "System Inference Profile (Base Model)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "  ├─ Application Inference Profile A (Tenant A)\n",
    "  ├─ Application Inference Profile B (Tenant B)\n",
    "  └─ Application Inference Profile C (Tenant C)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Each AIP = Unique ARN = Isolated CloudWatch Metrics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏷️ Tagging for Cost Allocation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tags = [\n",
    "    {'key': 'TenantId', 'value': 'tenant-a'},         # Who\n",
    "    {'key': 'Environment', 'value': 'production'},     # Where\n",
    "    {'key': 'CostCenter', 'value': 'engineering'},     # Billing\n",
    "    {'key': 'BusinessType', 'value': 'B2B-SaaS'}       # Context\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 The Multi-Tenant Isolation\n",
    "**Before (Lab 01 - System Inference Profile):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CloudWatch Metrics:\n",
    "└─ ModelId: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0...\n",
    "   └─ Invocations: 1000 (all tenants combined) ❌\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After (Lab 02 - Application Inference Profiles):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CloudWatch Metrics:\n",
    "├─ ModelId: arn:.../application-inference-profile/tenant-a\n",
    "│  └─ Invocations: 400 (isolated) ✅\n",
    "├─ ModelId: arn:.../application-inference-profile/tenant-b\n",
    "│  └─ Invocations: 350 (isolated) ✅\n",
    "└─ ModelId: arn:.../application-inference-profile/tenant-c\n",
    "   └─ Invocations: 250 (isolated) ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "As **Alex, Platform Engineer**, you can now tell your CEO:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **\"We can track costs per tenant!\"**\n",
    "- Each tenant has their own AIP with isolated metrics\n",
    "- Tags enable accurate cost allocation and chargeback\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **\"We can implement usage-based pricing!\"**\n",
    "- CloudWatch metrics provide exact per-tenant usage\n",
    "- Billing can be automated based on actual consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **\"We can monitor SLAs per tenant!\"**\n",
    "- Separate metrics allow individual performance tracking\n",
    "- Can identify and resolve tenant-specific issues\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **\"We can scale efficiently!\"**\n",
    "- One AIP per tenant, all using the same underlying model\n",
    "- No infrastructure duplication needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you learned **AIP management** (CRUD operations). But you haven't actually **used** AIPs for inference yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lab 03**: Use AIPs with boto3 for real multi-tenant inference\n",
    "- **Lab 04**: Build agent applications with Strands + AIPs\n",
    "- **Lab 05**: Deploy to production with AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "- **Labs 6-8**: Optional integrations (LiteLLM, LangChain, LangGraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 When to Use AIPs\n",
    "**Use Application Inference Profiles when:**\n",
    "- Building multi-tenant SaaS platforms\n",
    "- Need per-tenant cost tracking\n",
    "- Implementing usage-based billing\n",
    "- Monitoring SLAs per tenant\n",
    "- Require tenant isolation and compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use System Inference Profiles when:**\n",
    "- Single-tenant applications\n",
    "- Internal tools without cost allocation needs\n",
    "- Prototyping and development\n",
    "- Aggregate metrics are sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 The AIP Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Create AIP per tenant\n",
    "aip_arn = create_aip(tenant_id, tags)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Use AIP for inference (Lab 03)\n",
    "bedrock_runtime.invoke_model(modelId=aip_arn, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Monitor CloudWatch metrics\n",
    "metrics = get_metrics(aip_arn)  # Isolated per tenant!\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Calculate costs and billing\n",
    "bill = calculate_cost(metrics, pricing)\n",
    "```\n",
